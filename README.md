You're a cat on a noble mission: deliver the legendary fish to the Cat Queen.
Along the way, you'll face strange dreams, fuzzy memories, and plenty of silly challenges. 
It's my first time coding something like this, so expect bugs.

<h1>Development Log</h1>

Rewrote some dialogue, added intro screen and basic styling.

<h2>June 24, 2025</h2>

<h2>July 14, 2025</h2>
Major debugging milestone! The fight mechanic now works!!

<h1>Notes</h1>
This is a personal project, made for fun and learning.

Expect rough edges and a few weird bugs.

Enjoy the adventure—and may the Cat Queen bless your paws.
